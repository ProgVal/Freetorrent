Web server
==========

Software
--------

I use Apache with mod_wsgi, both from Debian repository (in apache2 package).

Configuration
-------------

This is a sample configuration you can edit to fit your own needs, available
under CC-0 licence.

<VirtualHost *:80>
	ServerName freetorrent

	DocumentRoot /home/progval/workspace/Freetorrent
	<Directory "/home/progval/workspace/Freetorrent">
		Options Indexes MultiViews FollowSymLinks +ExecCGI
		Order allow,deny
		Allow from all
	</Directory>
	<Location />
		Options Indexes MultiViews FollowSymLinks +ExecCGI
		SetHandler wsgi-script
		Order allow,deny
		Allow from all
	</Location>
	<Location '/static'>
		SetHandler None
	</Location>

	TransferLog /var/log/apache2/freetorrent.log
</VirtualHost>

Database
========

Engine
------

This software was designed, at the early start, to use SQLite database, but
MySQL appears to be better for our needs. SQLite might still work, but is
not supported.

Configuration
-------------

All configuration is in common/db.py file. As this software is not
designed to be distributed (but distributed because libre software is
the Good), there is no real configuration file.
